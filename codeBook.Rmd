Variable Names

The variable names are constructed as follows.  

-- First a prefix, t or f, depending on whether the measurement is in the time (t) or frequency (f) domain.

-- Secondly, "Body" or "Gravity", depending on whether the movement refers to gravitational motion or body motion.

-- Third, "Acc" denotes measurement on accelaration, "Gyro" on gyroscopic motion, "Jerk" on jerk signals.

Following these conventions, data on the following variables are represented in the tidy data file:


tGravityAcc
tBodyAcc 
tBodyJerk
tBodyGyro
tBodyAccJerk
tBodyGyroJerk

fBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk
fBodyGyro
fBodyGyroJerk

These variable names were appended with suffixes, as follows,
-- "Mag" denotes calculated Euclidean magnitude of the variable over the three coordinate axes (X, Y and Z).
-- Coordinate suffixes (X, Y, Z) denote the axis along which the measurement has been made.  
-- "Mean" and "StdDev" denote measurements of the mean and standard deviation, respectively.
